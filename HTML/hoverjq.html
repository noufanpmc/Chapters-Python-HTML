	<p id="para">A paragraph (from the Ancient Greek παράγραφος paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written beside") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences.[1][2] Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.</p>
